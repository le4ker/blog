title: A Suite of Whitehat Rootkits for the Linux kernel

tags: ["security", "opensource"]

Have you ever wondered what happens when an attacker gains complete control over
your system? Rootkits are malicious programs that run at the kernel level of an
operating system, essentially giving them god-like powers over your entire
machine.

While you might think "I'd never give root access to an attacker," the reality
is that social engineering tactics and zero-day vulnerabilities can make this
easier than you'd expect. Once installed, a rootkit can wreak havoc on your
system by hiding files and processes, deploying additional malware, stealing
passwords and certificates, and logging everything you do.

The scary part? Rootkits often modify the system call table, making their
malicious activities completely invisible to you. You could be compromised and
never know it.

To help protect against these threats, I developed a suite of kernel modules
that can prevent and detect rootkit activities. Let me walk you through what I
built and how it works.

## The Security Suite

Here's what I built to help defend against rootkits:

### **[The Drip Dry Carbonite](https://github.com/le4ker/linux-kernel-security-suite/tree/master/the-drip-dry-carbonite)**

This module acts as a guardian for your system call table and continuously logs
snapshots of running processes. Think of it as a security camera that watches
the most critical parts of your system. If anything tries to modify the system
call table, the module immediately freezes the machine to prevent further
damage.

### **[Dresden](https://github.com/le4ker/linux-kernel-security-suite/tree/master/dresden)**

Dresden is like a bouncer at the kernel's door. It blocks any attempts to insert
new modules (including rootkits) into the kernel, while also dumping instruction
memory and logging critical security events. As long as this module is loaded
last during boot, it can prevent most rootkits from even getting a foothold.

### **[Netlog](https://github.com/le4ker/linux-kernel-security-suite/tree/master/netlog)**

Network activity is often the first sign of compromise. Netlog monitors all
network traffic by probing the kernel's network stack, creating detailed logs
that can be invaluable for forensic analysis if a security breach occurs.

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing some interesting code snippets from these modules in future
posts. The reality is that rootkits are constantly evolving, so defensive tools
need to evolve too. These modules represent my approach to staying ahead of the
threat landscape.

Have you ever encountered rootkit detection challenges in your own systems? I'd
love to hear about your experiences and any additional defensive strategies
you've found effective.
