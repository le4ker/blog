[Last time]({% post_url 2017-04-23-sqlmap %}), we dumped the dvwa database of
[DVWA]({% post_url 2017-04-02-dvwa-kali %}), by exploiting an SQL injection in
it. As part of this dump, we extracted the user passwords.

These are not the user passwords themselves, but their
[hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) digest. The
hash digests are produced by using a hash function and the most important
property of this function, is that it's a one way function, meaning that it's
impossible to invert. This means that in order to find the original value, given
a hash digest, you have to attempt to guess the original value, calculate its
digest and then compare it with the value that you are trying to invert. Of
course since the hash functions are deterministic, you can also create and store
a mapping of values and digests, these are the so-called
[rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table).

In order to crack these digests, we need to know what cryptographic hash
function was used to produce them:

```bash
head -n 1 dvwa.hash | hash-identifier
```

Two possible hashes, but we'll start with guessing that MD5 was used. If we fail
to crack any password, then we should consider trying the Domain Cached
Credentials option.

Now we're good to get our hands on [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/). The
main reason hashcat is powerful, is because it will take advantage of the GPUs
of the system that is running on. Of course you can always rent some cloud
solution that offers GPU processing power, in order to add some more muscle to
your rig.

Hashcat has different attack modes, some of them being _straight_, _combination_
and _brute-force_. The straight attack mode will compute the hashes for all the
words that hashcat will find in the wordlist. The combination mode will try
combinations of the words that are in the wordlist, and the brute-force attack
will blindly try all the possible combinations. The brute-force mode is not
useful for passwords longer than 10 characters due to the combinatorial
explosion of the search space.

From the help menu of hashcat, you can find the code that corresponds to the
hash function that you will attack, in our case it's _0_ for MD5:

```bash
hashcat --help
```

We'll try to crack the DVWA passwords with a simple _straight_ attack mode (it's
DVWA after all..) and we'll use a simple wordlist of sqlmap:

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 dvwa.hash /usr/share/wordlists/sqlmap.txt
```

And just like that we've recovered the passwords. Note that hashcat creates a
potfile, where it stores all the passwords that have been recovered:

In the future we'll see more sophisticated usages of hashcat, in order to break
stronger passwords, which include numbers, capital letters and special
characters and phrases.
