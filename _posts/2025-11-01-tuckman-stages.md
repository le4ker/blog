Teams and groups within organizations are chaotic environments, people come and
go, projects start, get cancelled, paused, or end, and the organization itself
is constantly changing.
[Patterns can be found in chaotic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)
though, and identifying these patterns will help you manage your stress and
improve your performance, no matter if you are a manager or an individual
contributor. One staple of team dynamics is Tuckman's stages of group
development, which describes the stages that a team goes through from the moment
it is formed to the moment it is disbanded. These stages were defined in the
[“Developmental Sequence in Small Groups”](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Dynamics/Tuckman_1965_Developmental_sequence_in_small_groups.pdf)
paper that was published in 1965.

### The Stages

#### Forming

This is the first stage of a team, when team members are recruited and assigned
with a team wide goal. During this stage the team members are usually polite and
friendly, and they are trying to identify what their boundaries are when it
comes to interpersonal relationships with other group members, the leaders and
preexisting standards. The team leader is usually the one who is the most active
in this stage and will take the most initiatives, by assigning tasks and roles
to the team members. During the forming stage the team is naturally not very
productive.

#### Storming

This is the second stage of a team, when the team members start to push against
the boundaries that were established in the first stage. Conflict and
polarization around interpersonal issues are common, while the team members
start to compete for status and acceptance. The group leader is usually
challenged as part of this stage, and all these conflicts result into resistance
to group influence and task requirements. The team members are usually more
productive in this stage, as they grow more confident in their roles, while the
team leader is usually less active.

#### Norming

Norming is the next stage, where the resistance of the previous stage is
overcome, and ingroup feeling and cohesiveness develop, new standards evolve and
new roles are adopted. In this stage the team members take ownership and
responsibility, while they are motivated to work together in order to achieve
the team's goals. During norming, intimate personal opinions are expressed, as a
result of the psychological safety that the team members start to feel as part
of the group. As a result, the productivity is increased during norming,
compared to the previous stages.

#### Performing

During the Performing stage, interpersonal structures have been well established
and become a tool for accomplishing tasks. Roles become flexible and functional,
while the group’s energy is channeled into their tasks. This is the most
rewarding and enjoyable stage, as the team members are productive, which results
in achieving tasks and goals, which increases the group’s morale. They are also
more willing to take risks, as they are more confident in their abilities and
they are not afraid of being judged by their peers. Ideally the team will
achieve its end goal during this stage, but of course this is not always the
case. Team members will depart and the interpersonal dynamics will change again,
which results in regressing to earlier stages. This can cause disappointment and
frustration, but it's important to understand that this is normal and that the
team will eventually move to the next stage, usually faster than it did the last
time.

#### Adjourning

In 1977, Tuckman and Mary Ann Jensen
[published](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/105960117700200404) a fifth
stage, called Adjourning or Mourning. This final stage is usually reached either
by achieving the goal the team had set, or in extreme cases when the team has
been mismanaged so heavily by the leader, that the team members decide to leave.
At this stage the team members have to accept that the team is disbanding and
that they have to move on. This can be an intense stage, as the team members
have to say goodbye to their team members and the team leader.

### Startup edition

Startups are traditionally more chaotic environments than established companies,
which affects the Tuckman's stages in two ways. First, the stage cycles are
performed faster and second, the stages themselves are more intense. In Big Tech
companies for example, reorgs usually take place every two years in order to
catch up with the latest trends and opportunities of the industry. In a startup
though, where innovation is critical for the survival of the organization,
reorgs can happen as soon as every six months. This means that the teams will go
through the Tuckman stages faster, which can be disruptive and overwhelming.
Also, given how volatile environments when it comes to attrition startups are,
it’s common to see teams oscillating back and forth between the Forming,
Storming and Norming stages, even within a quarter. This is one of the startup
roller coasters that you have to ride if you have signed up for working in one.

### Questions to ask yourself and your team

- Has my team a conscious end goal?
- What stage is my team in?
- When did we enter this stage?
- What can I do to help my team move to the next stage?
- What can I do to help my team stay in this stage?
