title: Setting Up Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
category: tech
tags: ["security", "redteam"]
---

Ever wanted to practice your web security skills without the risk of breaking
the law or damaging real systems? That's exactly what Damn Vulnerable Web
Application (DVWA) was designed for.

DVWA is a deliberately insecure PHP/MySQL web application that serves as a safe
playground for security professionals, web developers, students, and educators.
Think of it as a controlled environment where you can experiment with real-world
vulnerabilities without any legal or ethical concerns.

The beauty of DVWA is that it provides a straightforward interface to practice
the most common web vulnerabilities at different difficulty levels. It includes
both well-documented vulnerabilities (perfect for learning) and some
undocumented ones (great for testing your discovery skills). This encourages you
to think like both an attacker and a defender.

## Getting Started with DVWA

I recommend setting up DVWA on Kali Linux since it comes with most of the
security tools you'll need pre-installed. DVWA requires Apache and MySQL, which
are already included with Kali, making the setup process much smoother.

### Step 1: Download and Extract DVWA

```bash
wget https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA/archive/master.zip -O dvwa.zip
unzip dvwa.zip
```

### Step 2: Start Required Services

```bash
service apache2 start
service mysql start
```

### Step 3: Deploy DVWA

```bash
mv DVWA-master /var/www/html/dvwa
cd /var/www/html
chmod -R 755 dvwa/
```

### Step 4: Configure the Database

After completing the setup, you'll need to update the MySQL password in the DVWA
configuration file to create the `dvwa` database:

### Step 5: Access and Configure DVWA

You can now access the login page by visiting `http://127.0.0.1/dvwa`. I
recommend starting with the default credentials (`admin`/`password`) and setting
the security level to `low` under the 'DVWA Security' tab. This will give you
access to the most straightforward vulnerabilities to begin learning:

## Important Security Reminders

⚠️ **Never expose this web application on a public network** - it's designed to
be vulnerable!

⚠️ **Always reset the security level to `impossible`** when you're done
practicing.

## What's Next?

In the next post, we'll dive into our first vulnerability exploitation - using
brute force techniques to gain access to the application without knowing the
password. This will give you hands-on experience with one of the most common
attack vectors in web security.

issues during the setup process!
