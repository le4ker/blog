title: Automating SQL Injection Exploitation with sqlmap
category: tech
tags: ["security", "redteam"]
---

In the [previous post]({% post_url 2017-04-22-sql-injections %}), we
demonstrated how to access user passwords in
[DVWA]({% post_url 2017-04-02-dvwa-kali %}) by exploiting its SQL Injection
vulnerability. This time, we'll use [sqlmap](https://sqlmap.org/), a powerful
and easy to use tool that automates the SQL injection exploitation process,
allowing us to dump entire databases with minimal effort.

In the previous post, we guessed that the column in the `users` table containing
passwords was called `password`. However, if our guess had been incorrect, we
would have needed to inject a UNION SQL query on the information schema database
of the DBMS to retrieve the tables and columns of the targeted database. This
process differs for each DBMS and can be time-consuming. Fortunately, sqlmap
automates this process and more.

With sqlmap, we can automatically detect injectable parameters in a web
application and dump whole databases, tables, and columns. It also has built-in
exploitation and password cracking automation features, though we won't be
exploring those in this post as we will be using
[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) and
[Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) for these purposes. Instead, we will
focus on exploiting the same SQL injection vulnerability as in the previous
post, performing information gathering on the server, and dumping all its
databases.

First, we'll start by intercepting the HTTP request of the SQL injection form
using Burp and saving it to a request file. Then we'll pass this file to sqlmap,
which will detect the injectable parameters that it can inspect for SQL
injections:

To start using sqlmap, we need to provide it with the request file we saved
earlier. Sqlmap can automatically parse the file and detect parameters that may
be vulnerable to SQL injection:

```bash
sqlmap -r request
```

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-0.png)

When sqlmap finds an injectable parameter, it prompts us to choose whether to
skip payloads for the rest of the database management system (in this case,
MySQL). Then sqlmap will do information gathering about the system, such as the
version, current database, and current user.

If sqlmap successfully identifies an injectable parameter, it will ask if we
want to continue searching for more. However, if we've found what we need, we
can stop and move on to the next step.

Even after sqlmap exits, it will have saved information about the request for
future use. Let's use sqlmap to gather more information, such as the database
management system version, the current database, and the current user:

```bash
sqlmap -r request --banner --current-user --current-db
```

Now, let's list the tables in the dvwa database:

```bash
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa --tables
```

Next, let's list the columns in the `users` table:

```bash
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa -T users --columns
```

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-5.png)

We can also dump the contents of the `user` and `password` columns in the
"users" table:

```bash
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa -T users -C user,password --dump
```

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-7.png)

However, if we want to dump the entire dvwa database (which is small in our
case), we can use the following command:

```bash
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa --dump
```

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-8.png)

As a bonus, we can also list all databases on the server:

```bash
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa --dbs
```

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-9.png)

And, if we want to dump all databases on the server, we can use the following
command:

```bash
sqlmap -r request --dump-all
```

In case you didn't notice, the stored XSS that we discovered in a past
[post]({% post_url 2017-04-15-dvwa-xss %}), ca be seen in the dumped data as
well.
