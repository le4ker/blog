title: Understanding Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Attacks

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a type of attack that allows an attacker to inject
client-side instructions into a web application that is viewed by other users.
This type of attack is very dangerous since an attacker can access the victim's
local storage and steal information like your session ID in order to deliver a
session-hijacking, which can lead to identity theft within the web application.
XSS vulnerabilities are at the top of the
[OWASP Top Ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=OWASP_Top_10_for_2017_Release_Candidate)
web application vulnerabilities, making this kind of attack very valuable.

The anatomy of the attack is simple. Any user input can be an attack surface
where an attacker can enter JavaScript code. If the web application returns this
input to the client without encoding the `<` and `>` characters, the browser
will interpret the script tags as trusted JavaScript instructions sent by the
web application and execute it. From that point, the attacker can get access to
the web page's cookie:

```javascript
&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;
```

To demonstrate how XSS works, we can use the DVWA web application and navigate
to the _Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)_ section. The form asks for our
name, so let's say we are John Smith:

![xss](/img/posts/xss/xss-0.png)

Then, we can inject the JavaScript code as shown in the example.:

![xss](/img/posts/xss/xss-1.png)

As a result, we obtained our own cookie. However, the question remains: how can
we steal another user's cookie?

It turns out that user input is sent to the server as GET parameters, which
means that our JavaScript code is included in the URL:

```html
http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;
```

If we send this URL to a victim and the victim clicks on it (assuming they are
logged into the web application), we will obtain their cookie.

It's worth noting that this attack can be made harder to detect by encoding the
URL, making it more difficult for users to recognize that they are being
targeted:

```html
http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r%2F%3Fname%3D%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C%2Fscript%3E%0A%0A
```

Much harder to see that it's an XSS attack, isn't it?

However, the exploit is not yet complete, as our goal is to send the victim's
cookie to a server that we control. This way, we can take over the victim's
session. For the sake of this post, we will skip this part as it is out of
scope.

It's worth noting that DVWA categorizes XSS vulnerabilities into two types:
Reflected XSS and Stored XSS. Reflected XSS attacks require the victim to submit
the injected code, which is then reflected back to the server via the victim's
browser. On the other hand, Stored XSS attacks occur when we manage to persist
the injected code on the web server itself. This is the most powerful type of
XSS attack, as any user who visits the affected page will be served with the
injected JavaScript code. A recent example of a Stored XSS attack was
[found against Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv0kZKC6GAM&feature=youtu.be),
where the injected code retweeted the original tweet whenever it appeared on a
user's timeline.

Let's move on to the Stored XSS section in DVWA. This section requires us to
input a name and a message. Let's assume we are John Smith, and we will input
"Hello World" as the message:

![xss](/img/posts/xss/xss-2.png)

Now, let's inject our JavaScript in either of the two fields available:

![xss](/img/posts/xss/xss-3.png)

The injected code is now stored in DVWA's database and will be executed every
time the page is loaded. If you want to remove the injected code, you can
recreate the DVWA database.
