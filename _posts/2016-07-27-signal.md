If you're serious about privacy and security in your messaging, you've probably
heard of [Signal](https://signal.org/). It's widely considered the gold standard
for secure messaging, offering both excellent user experience and
state-of-the-art security.

The Signal Protocol, developed by the
[Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/) team, provides seamless
end-to-end encryption for all communications - text, voice, and media. The
protocol is so robust that it's been adopted by major platforms like WhatsApp
and is currently being rolled out in Messenger.

As of version 2.4, Signal for [iOS](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS) now
supports Greek as a language. This was actually a small contribution I made to
the project. I was surprised to discover that my favorite secure messaging app
didn't support Greek, so I decided to help out.

The translation process was straightforward, and I was impressed by how
responsive and helpful the Signal team was throughout the process. It's always
encouraging to see open-source projects that welcome community contributions and
make the process smooth for newcomers.

If you haven't tried Signal yet, I highly recommend giving it a shot -
especially if privacy and security are important to you. And if you're
interested in contributing to open-source projects, Signal is a great place to
start!
